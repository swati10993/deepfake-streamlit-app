# Deepfake Detection Using Deep Learning

## Project Description
This project detects whether an image or video contains a real or fake (deepfake) face using deep learning techniques. 
The Xception model is used for classification.

## Features
- Upload an image to check if it is real or fake
- User-friendly Streamlit interface
- Sidebar navigation: Home, Upload Image, About Project

## Dataset
- FaceForensics++ dataset used for training the model

## Libraries Required
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- Streamlit
- NumPy
- PIL

## How to Run Locally
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/swati10993/deepfake-streamlit-app.git
